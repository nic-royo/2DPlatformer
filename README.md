Simple JavaScript 2D side scroller game, used the p5.js  library
This was made on my first semester as a CS student, so its very rough around the edges. It contains one level on a game, with simple platforming and enemies to avoid
Contains simple graphics. Has 4 files, including a sketch.js file which must be run in order for the game to be playable on the web browser
Preferably, use Google Chrome as multiple errors came up when I tried using firefox and other browsers.
